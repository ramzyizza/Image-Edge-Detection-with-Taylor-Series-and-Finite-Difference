# Image-Edge-Detection-with-Taylor-Series-and-Finite-Difference
This Python project implements Taylor series derivatives and finite difference methods to detect edges in images, efficiently highlighting the boundaries between objects. The approach converts RGB images to grayscale, then computes both first and second derivatives to pinpoint edges.
